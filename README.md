## This theme expects a few `.Site.Data` parameters

- Hugo provides the content of yaml files (as well as some other data formats) as follows:
  - `docsRoot/data/File.yaml` becomes `.Site.Data.File.DataField.SubField[index].Etc`
- Specifically, this theme uses the following files/parameters
- `data/Solo.yaml` (generated by docs build script in docs dir)
- `data/ProtoMap.yaml` (generated by solo-kit during code generation)
