## This theme expects a few `.Site.Data` parameters

- Hugo provides the content of yaml files (as well as some other data formats) as follows:
  - `docsRoot/data/File.yaml` becomes `.Site.Data.File.DataField.SubField[index].Etc`
- Specifically, this theme uses the following files/parameters
- `data/Solo.yaml` (generated by docs build script in docs dir)
  - DocsVersion: either has the form of "/product/version" or "" empty string
    - "product" could be `gloo`, `squash`, etc
    - "version" will be a sem-ver specification of the form `x-y-z`
  - CodeVersion: either shows the version in the form `x.y.z` or the string `dev`

example:
```yaml
DocsVersion: /gloo/2-3-4
CodeVersion: 2.3.4
```

- `data/ProtoMap.yaml` (generated by solo-kit during code generation)
  - consists of `map[string]Summary`
    - key represents the proto import path (a cannonical UUID)
    - value represents the key info needed about the proto when rendering the docs
      - relativepath: path from the documentation instance's version-scoped root to the served page
      - other fields may be added later

example:
```yaml
apis:
  als.plugins.gloo.solo.io.AccessLog:
    relativepath: api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/plugins/als/als.proto.sk#AccessLog
    package: als.plugins.gloo.solo.io
  als.plugins.gloo.solo.io.AccessLoggingService:
    relativepath: api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/plugins/als/als.proto.sk#AccessLoggingService
    package: als.plugins.gloo.solo.io
```

## This theme fork introduces a few new shortcodes

- `layouts/shortcodes/protobuf.html`
  - useful when wanting to link to a protobuf
- `layouts/shortcodes/versioned_link_path.html`
  - required in order for links to work (injects version prefix)
